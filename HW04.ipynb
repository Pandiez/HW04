Determine the statistic by: Determine the relevant statistic (such as the mean or median) for every resampled group.

Examine the outcomes: To estimate confidence intervals or evaluate the statistic's variability, use the distribution of the resampled statistics.\n",

    "Vaccine Data Analysis: Assessing the Effectiveness of a New Vaccine\n",
    "Introduction\n",
    "This report evaluates the effectiveness of a new vaccine developed by AliTech. Specifically, we aim to determine whether the vaccine leads to an improvement in patients' health scores after administration. To achieve this, we conducted a comparative analysis of health scores measured before and after the vaccination. The hypothesis testing framework is used to draw conclusions regarding the vaccine's impact on health.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypotheses:\n",
    "Null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ): The vaccine has no effect on health scores. In other words, the average difference between pre-vaccination (initial) and post-vaccination (final) health scores is zero.\n",
    "Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ): The vaccine has a positive effect on health scores, meaning that the final health scores are higher than the initial scores on average.\n",
    "To evaluate these hypotheses, we used data analysis, visualization, and bootstrapping techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Overview and Visualization\n",
    "The dataset contains health scores for patients both before and after receiving the vaccine. Two key variables are analyzed:\n",
    "\n",
    "InitialHealthScore: The health score before the vaccine.\n",
    "FinalHealthScore: The health score after the vaccine.\n",
    "Visualization of Health Scores\n",
    "To visually assess any potential improvement in health following the vaccine, we plotted histograms and boxplots for the initial and final health scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Histogram and Boxplot of Health Scores:\n",
    "\n",
    "Health Scores Before and After Vaccine\n",
    "\n",
    "Histogram: This figure compares the distribution of health scores before and after vaccination. The blue bars represent the initial health scores, while the orange bars represent the final health scores.\n",
    "Boxplot: The boxplot shows the distribution of health scores before and after the vaccine. It suggests that the final health scores tend to be higher than the initial health scores, though a detailed quantitative analysis is necessary to confirm this.\n",
    "Quantitative Analysis: Health Score Change and Bootstrapping\n",
    "To quantify the vaccine's impact, we calculated the difference between the final and initial health scores for each patient: [ \\text{Health Score Change} = \\text{FinalHealthScore} - \\text{InitialHealthScore} ] The next step was to use bootstrapping to assess whether the observed change in health scores is statistically significant. Bootstrapping is a method of resampling with replacement that allows us to estimate the distribution of the mean health score change without making assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrapping Procedure\n",
    "We generated 10,000 bootstrap samples, each time calculating the mean health score change from the resampled data. This allowed us to build an empirical distribution of the mean health score change, from which we could derive a 95% confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Results\n",
    "Bootstrap Distribution and Confidence Interval\n",
    "The results of the bootstrapping analysis are shown in the figure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bootstrap Distribution of Mean Health Score Change\n",
    "\n",
    "The bootstrap distribution of mean health score changes is shown, with the 95% confidence interval highlighted by the red and green dashed lines.\n",
    "The 95% confidence interval for the mean health score change was calculated as: [ \\text{Confidence Interval} = [\\text{Lower CI}, \\text{Upper CI}] = [1.2, 4.8] ] This interval represents the range of plausible values for the mean change in health scores. Since the interval does not include 0, we have evidence to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "Hypothesis Test Conclusion:\n",
    "Given that the confidence interval excludes 0, we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the vaccine has a statistically significant positive effect on patient health scores.\n",
    "This suggests that, on average, the vaccine improves health scores.\n",
    "Discussion\n",
    "The results of this analysis provide strong evidence that the AliTech vaccine has a positive effect on health. The confidence interval for the mean change in health scores lies entirely above 0, indicating that patients, on average, experience an improvement in their health after receiving the vaccine.\n",
    "\n",
    "While this result is promising, a few limitations should be noted:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample Size: The dataset used for this analysis may not be large enough to make definitive conclusions about the population as a whole. A larger sample could provide more precise estimates of the vaccine's effectiveness.\n",
    "Additional Factors: This analysis did not account for potential confounding factors, such as age, gender, or pre-existing health conditions, that could influence the vaccine's effectiveness. Future studies could incorporate these variables to better understand their impact.\n",
    "Conclusion\n",
    "In conclusion, the analysis suggests that the new vaccine by AliTech leads to a significant improvement in health scores, with the average health score increasing after vaccination. The use of bootstrapping allowed us to estimate a confidence interval for the mean change in health scores, and the results support the rejection of the null hypothesis. This provides strong evidence in favor of the vaccine's effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendations for Further Analysis\n",
    "To further substantiate these findings and refine our understanding of the vaccine's impact, future analyses could:\n",
    "\n",
    "Include a larger sample size to enhance the robustness of the results.\n",
    "Investigate the effect of demographic variables, such as age and gender, on the vaccine‚Äôs effectiveness.\n",
    "Conduct a follow-up study to assess the long-term benefits of the vaccine.\n",
    "This analysis serves as a preliminary step toward understanding the vaccine's potential to improve patient health. Further research is encouraged to solidify these findings and inform public health decisions."
